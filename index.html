          <p>From an early age, I’ve had a passion for technology, business and anything finance related. It therefore came as no surprise when I studied MEng Computer Engineering at the University of Portsmouth whilst simultaneously starting my own business.</p>
          <p>A lot of people were therefore confused why I didn’t continue my own business upon graduating and instead joined NATS (UK air traffic control) on their engineering graduate scheme. The honest answer is that I love the criticality of air traffic control - something that most people take for granted and don’t even think about.</p>
          <p>So what about my passion for business and finance? That’s where The Wheal Group fits in. Before you ask, no, I don’t want to one day quit my day job and run it full-time. Consider it more like a hobby - a hobby that I pay other people to run.</p>
